- 👋 Hi, I’m @jearevalo
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding front-end coding and data management to support further developing of information technologies in Libraries. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the web development basics (HTML, CSS, JS), and looking forward to learning database and server management code like PHP, Python, SQL, and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. Trying to learn some coding languages for now.
- 📫 Not available.
